== TO-DO list

- BUG: tags defined in the layout are not accessible within pages

- BUG: attribute expansion: they are expanded only once, so they don't work as expected inside loops

- apply parametrizable snippets patch provided by Mario T. Lanza <mlanza(at)comcast.net>

- DOC: <r:erb>: when expanding HTML generating tags like <r:link> inside <%= %> it must be evaluated as a q{ } string to avoid problems with <, >, ', " characters

- attribute expansion: make expansion prefix (by default "=") configurable in "config" table of database (use a key like "extension.back-door.expansion-prefix")

- DEV: switch to rspec + rcov

- add an "expr" attribute to <r:ruby> tag, so it evaluates the expression but does not render the value.  For example:

  <r:ruby expr="@limit = 3" />

  is equal to

  <r:ruby> @limit = 3; "" </r:ruby>

  maybe also add a "silent=true|false" attribute so nothing is returned

- <tag>s inside <r:erb> tags with ruby loops don't expand multiple times
    - the solution is to first apply the ERB filter and then expand the result
    - seems that this is not possible with Radius
    - for more info refer to the <r:erb> and <r:expand> documentation

- improve security
    - setting the $SAFE variable does not seem useful
    - Maybe also add a simple YAML file with the list of users allowed to use the tags.

- implement extra tags like <r:case>, <r:each> and <r:times>

- parametrized snippets:
  "
  I like the idea of parametrized snippets.  I hope that the core team
considers this for future releases, i believe that the idea is simple and
fits in the philosophy of Radiant.

   I would suggest to add the parameters individually to the <r:snippet>
tag, and to allow a body to be defined:

   <r:snippet name="rounded-box" class="whatever" bg-color="blue">
        This is a parametrized snippet...
   </r>

    The "name" attribute is reserved.  The user is free to use any other,
and they will be passed to the snippet code, may be with a <r:param> and
<r:body> tag:

    <div class="<r:param name="class"> rounded"
style="background-color:<r:param name="bg-color">" >
        <r:body>
    </div>

     Backdoor 0.3.0 has a <r:tag> and <r:erb_tag> that can be used as
parametrized snippets, but it has the known security implications.
